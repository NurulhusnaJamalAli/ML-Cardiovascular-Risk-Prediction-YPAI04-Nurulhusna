# ML Cardiovascular Risk Prediction YPAI04 Nurulhusna
 This is an exercise about applying machine learning and feature engineering techniques to predict cardiovascular disease risk by Nurulhusna (YPAI04)

This project presents a unique opportunity to apply machine learning skills to develop a predictive model for cardiovascular disease. Using the provided training and testing datasets, the objective is to design, train, and optimize a machine learning pipeline that includes feature engineering steps. The project aims to build a model that effectively predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease by leveraging new features derived from existing ones.

## Data Source

The dataset for this project can be obtained from the following Kaggle link:

[Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Jupyter Notebook: The project will be developed in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

2. Python (>=3.6): The project will be implemented in Python, so Python 3.6 or later versions are required.

### Project Steps

1. Data Analysis and Pre-processing:

   Start by exploring the 'cardio_train.csv' dataset. Perform necessary data cleaning steps, including handling outliers, missing values, and categorical variables.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   Conduct an in-depth EDA to gain insights into the data. Use visualizations effectively to uncover patterns, relationships, and correlations among the variables.

3. Feature Engineering:

   Based on the findings from the EDA, create new features that can potentially improve the predictive power of the model. Justify the choice of these new features.

4. Model Selection and Training:

   Choose an appropriate machine learning model for this classification problem. Train the selected model using the preprocessed and feature-engineered data from the 'cardio_train.csv' file.

5. Model Evaluation and Optimization:

   Evaluate the model's performance using the 'cardio_test.csv' dataset. Apply techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.

6. Pipeline Creation:

   Build a machine learning pipeline that automates the entire process, from data pre-processing to making predictions. This pipeline should facilitate seamless experimentation and testing with different models and feature combinations.

7. Documentation:

   Document the entire process, including data cleaning steps, EDA findings, feature engineering rationale, model selection, and optimization. Discuss any challenges faced during the project and how they were overcome. Provide insights into the impact of feature engineering on model performance and suggestions for future improvements.
